3. Navigate to **Settings** or **Configuration**
4. Find the **Allowed Domains** or **Domain Whitelist** section

- `index-iframe.html` - Alternative standalone iframe version (backup)

## 🔧 Configuration

The workflow is pre-configured in `app.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    workflowId: 'wf_68f6ab81d6f88190a1dec39a2e92d45e0f1a0f65064df00b',
    version: '1',
    publicKey: 'domain_pk_68f6df7bf2888190bf6a77c5e40ae8bd090668efb04679ad'
};
```

### 🔒 Security & Authentication

This app uses **OpenAI's official Agent Embed** with **domain whitelist authentication**:

✅ **Official OpenAI embed** - most reliable integration method  
✅ **Public key authentication** - safe to include in client-side code  
✅ **Domain-based access control** - only your approved domains work  
✅ **No private credentials exposed** - the public key is meant to be public  
✅ **No CDN dependencies** - direct connection to OpenAI  
✅ **Production-ready** - officially supported by OpenAI

The iframe connects directly to `agent.openai.com` and authentication happens server-side, which verifies both the public key and that the request comes from an allowed domain.

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `style.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-pink: #f8b4d9;
    --soft-pink: #fce4ec;
    --primary-green: #81c784;
    /* ... more colors */
}
```

### Example Questions
Update the buttons in `index.html`:

```html
<button class="example-btn" data-question="Your question here">
    Your question here
</button>
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to initialize chat" or messages not sending
1. **Check domain whitelist**: Make sure your GitHub Pages domain is added in OpenAI Agent Builder
   - Go to your workflow settings in OpenAI
   - Verify the domain is exactly: `yourusername.github.io`
   - No `https://`, no `www.`, no trailing slash
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for detailed error messages
3. **Verify workflow ID** is correct in `app.js`

### ChatKit not loading
- Check your internet connection (ChatKit loads via CDN)
- Open browser console (F12) to see detailed error messages
- Try refreshing the page

### Works on localhost but not on GitHub Pages
- Double-check you added the correct GitHub Pages domain to OpenAI
- Make sure you're using the exact domain format: `username.github.io`
- Changes to domain whitelist may take a few minutes to propagate

### Domain authentication errors
- Confirm the domain whitelist includes your GitHub Pages URL
- For custom domains, add both the apex domain and www subdomain
- Remove any test domains like `*` or `localhost` in production
